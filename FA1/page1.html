		<p>The Smiths is an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. 
           Their line-up comprised singer Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke, and drummer Mike Joyce. 
           They are regarded as one of the most important acts to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. </p>
           <p> The three songs that really struck my heart with them were:
		<li>There Is a Light That Never Goes Out</li>
		<li>Heaven knows I'm miserable now</li>
    <li>Panic</li>
